# 3DScaffoldImaging

Code for anaylzing a set of tiff files of fibroblasts growing on top of a collagen matrix. The images have been obtained with 2-photon microscopy and are taken at varying slices into the sample. The software first segments all of the cells from the scans and afterwards plots their distribution as well as calculated various metrics to describe those cellular distributions.
